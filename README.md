# Neurobot-1000 Web

I decided to write a web to organize every research, documentation, helper, and many other for Neurobot-1000.

## Why?

Because it is more accessible than Discord (require no account to look), and discussion/contribution can be made on the repo directly.

## Documentation

All of the required documentation is stored on [the site](https://neurobot-1000.github.io) (github pages really), including the individual packages, tools, and recommended contributing setup.
