# Eyes

Biologically, real eyes seem to be: fisheye lens - mechanical iris - double convex lens
fisheye lenses and double convex lenses of the required sizes can be bought.
Mechanical irises can be 3D printed and tiny geared down motors could turn a geared mechanical iris.
A different motor could also move the double convex lens or fisheye back and forth as well. Since lens spin orientation doesn't matter, you can screw and unscrew lenses without causing any issues.

>"Regular FDM XY resolution is 400 micrometers. Resin printers can go down to 40 micrometer XY resolution"\
>"That thing looks roughly 10cm in diameter, and 10x smaller would put it around 1cm, which is around the size of the microscop mechanical irises if a bit smaller, and should fit in a reasonable sized eye"

### Shopping

Small mechanical irises for microscopes can also be bought, but they are manually opened and closed with a slider on the side, while for action from the robot, a gear system would be better. This is an example product on [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Srutueo-Adjustable-Mechanical-Microscope-500042571A4/dp/B0D4GXTLK5)
