multi-material 3d printing can be especially useful for gears, where pitting is a huge factor which TPU could reduce, but bending the gear teeth is not desirable and stiffer materials would be better.

## multi-tool 3d printers

There is a very recent open source 3d printer where the bottom plate spins and the tools are on the sides. While the video depicts only one tool, this set up would allow as many tools as there are columns on the side. It's potentially the best set up for creating things like touch sensor systems, circuits-in-print using a wire embedding head, and quickly making multi-material prints.

## tool changing 3d printers

There are a few tool changing 3d printers and open source tool changers available that would allow multi-material 3d printing better than single tool multi material 3d printers. A sample [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO8XnWPwyjA)

## multi-material assembly

If multi-material 3d printers aren't available, some parts may be assembled from different materials, such as placing touch nylon gears within thin tpu gear walls that were printed seperatly
