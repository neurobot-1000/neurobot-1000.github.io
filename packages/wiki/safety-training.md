title: Safety Training
---

In order to have Neuro safely control a robot, she needs to learn the difference between life and video games. Or at least learn which contexts life is much more valuable in

Some initial ways to teach this would be:
* pokemon Nuzlocke
* permadeath tamogotchi games
* raising amoebas or ant farms
* raising tiny robots (such as with the simulated C. elegans connectome)
