# General Overview

An excerpt about [Neuro-sama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-sama) from Wikipedia:

> <p style="text-align: justify;">Neuro-sama is an artificial intelligence VTuber and chatbot that livestreams on her creator's Twitch channel "vedal987". Her speech and personality are powered by an artificial intelligence (AI) system which utilizes a large language model, allowing her to communicate with viewers in the stream's chat. She was created by a computer programmer and AI developer named Vedal, who had the idea of an AI VTuber by combining a large language model with a computer-animated avatar. Her avatars, or models, are designed by the VTuber Anny, of the channel "annytf". She debuted on Twitch on 19 December 2022. As of January 2025, Neuro-sama is the seventh most-subscribed channel on Twitch of all time.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As the name of the project suggest, this is a fan project to recreate the avatar of the AI VTuber in the form of humanoid robot in realistic proportion as closely as possible. The goals is to mimic human and have the AI be able to pilot the robot as the brains, complete with the sensory input.</p>
